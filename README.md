<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Project Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://longpdo.github.io)

This is my personal website built with `Jekyll` and hosted on `Github Pages`, which is based on the new `Neumorphism` design trend and was developed with a mobile-first approach.. This can be used by developers, who want to showcase their resume and portfolio. If you want to use this for your own portfolio, I have created a boilerplate version of this without my branding, another preloader and [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) integrated into the landing page. Fork the repository [Neumorphism](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism) and then refer to the [README](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism/blob/master/README.md) for more.
